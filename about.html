      <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">One of the things that never fails to amaze me is just how skewed our perceptions of the world have become in the digital age. Instead of everyone getting their information from a few mainstream and reputable sources like they used to, people can now choose where they look for their information. Whether that be CNN, Fox News, or even social media, the news outlets with which one chooses to focus their energy ultimately determines how that same individual feels about key political and social issues.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">The goal of this project is to make you think about how the information you take in (and the people giving you that information) on a daily basis influence your perception. How might someone else who gets their information from a different source be influenced compared to you? You might think that your preferred source is the correct source, but who is to say what is real and what isn't except for the people who actually lived the experience being reported to you?</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">I hope this project made you re-evaluate on some level how you get your own news and present said news to others, or at the very least helped you relate to those with different opinions than yourself. Once you understand that the other side of any given debate is coming from the same potentially uneducated place you are (I mean, come on, you can't <i>always</i> be right), it might be easier to find some common ground.</div>
