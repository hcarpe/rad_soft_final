      <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">The American Psychological Association defines confirmation bias as the tendency to gather evidence that confirms preexisting expectations, typically by emphasizing or pursuing supporting evidence while dismissing or failing to seek contradictory evidence. It would be like, say, suspecting that the reason your cheese business is doing so well is because a bunch of UK citizens are immigrating to the US.</div>

You had a consultative meeting with your top three, and they all have a British accent! That can’t be coincidental, so you assume the reason so many lawyers have recently popped up in Illinois is because they’re all immigrating from the UK.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">The graphs look legit, but can someone really definitively say that any of these assumptions are true? No, they can’t. Confirmation bias happens every second of every day, and most of the time we are none the wiser. Why? Because people can believe what they want to believe, <a href="https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations" taregt="blank">find the necessary data to back their claim up,</a> and present their version of the truth to whoever is listening. How are you supposed to know that the only reason your mom knows parsley is the secret ingredient to great pasta is because she asked the waitress what was in her own pasta when she was out to lunch with her girlfriends one day? How is your mom supposed to know that the waitress got the ingredient wrong and the actual ingredient the chef used that day was oregano?</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">The pie chart on the left is the percentage of doctors that recommend each toothpaste. The chart on the right is which dentist recommended which toothpaste. Now, say that the company that produces paste 1 put out an advertisement that 80% of dentists recommend their toothpaste. Yes, that is true based on the second graph; 80% of dentists did recommend their toothpaste. What they failed to mention, however, is that 100% of dentists recommended paste 2 and that overall, paste 2 is 7% more likely to be recommended by any other toothpaste. They didn’t lie, but they sure as hell didn’t tell the truth either <a href="https://marketinglaw.osborneclarke.com/retailing/colgates-80-of-dentists-recommend-claim-under-fire/" target="blank">(just ask the UK court system).</a></div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">See that graph? That’s a margin of error graph. What's margin of error, you ask? <a href="https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/hypothesis-testing/margin-of-error/#:~:text=The%20margin%20of%20error%20can,Standard%20error%20of%20the%20sample" target="blank">Statisticshowto.com</a> defines margin of error as telling you “how many percentage points your results will differ from the real population value. For example, a 95% confidence interval with a 4 percent margin of error means that your statistic will be within 4 percentage points of the real population value 95% of the time”. For example, if a poll states that there is a 98% confidence interval of 4.88 and 5.26, that means if the poll is repeated using the same techniques, the sample will be a true measurement of the population (fall between 4.88 and 5.26) 98% of the time. What the margin of error graph shows us is a physical representation of the population measurement possibilities.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">We want our data to be right in the middle, so that half of the samples potentially fall over the actual population measurement and half of the samples potentially fall over the actual measurement. The larger the sample size, the smaller the margin of error gets. Therefore, the larger your sample size, the more accurate your population measurement will be. Look at the table and margin of error graph for the US population below:</div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">Do you see how fast the margin of error drops based on how many people surveyed? <a href="https://www.pollfish.com/margin-of-error-calculator/" target="blank">Pollfish</a> reports that an acceptable margin of error used by most survey researchers typically falls between 4% and 8% at the 95% confidence level. If you’re surveying the entire US population, you only have to survey 150 people to have an 8% margin of error. You only have to survey 600 to get to a 4% margin of error! That isn’t a lot of people considering the US has a population of approximately 328,200,000.<div>
