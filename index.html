      <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">Have you ever wanted something so bad you were willing to bend the truth to get it? Or believed in something so strongly that nothing could convince you otherwise? That, my friends, is confirmation bias, and it’s everywhere around us.</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">The American Psychological Association defines confirmation bias as the tendency to gather evidence that confirms preexisting expectations, typically by emphasizing or pursuing supporting evidence while dismissing or failing to seek contradictory evidence. It would be like, say, suspecting that the reason your cheese business is doing so well is because a bunch of UK citizens are immigrating to the US.</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">Or, maybe, you live in Chicago and ran into some trouble with the law. You need a lawyer, but there are so many to choose from! You had a consultative meeting with your top three, and they all have a British accent! That can’t be coincidental, so you assume the reason so many lawyers have recently popped up in Illinois is because they’re all immigrating from the UK.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">The graphs look legit, but can someone really definitively say that any of these assumptions are true? No, they can’t. Confirmation bias happens every second of every day, and most of the time we are none the wiser. Why? Because people believe what they want to believe and present their version of the truth to whoever is listening. How are you supposed to know that the only reason your mom knows parsley is the secret ingredient to great pasta is because she asked the waitress what was in her own pasta when she was out to lunch with her girlfriends one day? How is your mom supposed to know that the waitress got the ingredient wrong and the actual ingredient the chef used that day was oregano?</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>

    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">Another more serious example of confirmation bias can be seen when we examine data from the CDC about the main causes of death in the US in 2020. Look at how many people died from COVID-19!</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">See anything new? That’s because there is something new—two new things to be exact. Yes, a lot of people did pass away from COVID-19 in 2020, but the first graph completely omits the number of people who died from heart disease and cancer, the US’s two leading causes in 2020, respectively. When a graph as bad as the first one is presented on the news (and trust me, it has been), it misleads people to believe that the number of deaths related to COVID-19, while still high, was the leading cause of US deaths in 2020 by a vast margin when that simply isn’t the case. This kind of confirmation bias is especially hard to spot because you, the viewer, are being forced to align your views with whoever is presenting the data to you. This kind of confirmation bias becomes problematic when it isn’t just your mom determining which ingredient guarantees the best plate of pasta you’ve ever had.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">How, you might ask, do people get away with such blatant data misrepresentation? One way to do it is by asking leading questions to get the desired answer in surveys. Check this example out:</div>

    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">The pie chart on the left is the percentage of doctors that recommend each toothpaste. The chart on the right is which dentist recommended which toothpaste. Now, say that the company that produces paste 1 put out an advertisement that 80% of dentists recommend their toothpaste. Yes, that is true based on the second graph; 80% of dentists did recommend their toothpaste. What they failed to mention, however, is that 100% of dentists recommended paste 2 and that overall, paste 2 is 7% more likely to be recommended by any other toothpaste. They didn’t lie, but they sure as hell didn’t tell the truth either (just ask the UK court system).</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">Another easy way to mislead people is by truncating your Y-axis. Below are two graphs showcasing the number of southwest border apprehensions between 2011 and 2013. Why do they look so different? Because the Y-axis on the first one begins at 15,500 and the Y-axis on the second one begins at 0.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">Fox News likes to use this tactic when they want to make the Obama administration look worse at controlling immigration at the Mexican border than they actually are. This phenomenon isn’t limited to right-wing news outlets, however, and instead lends itself to anyone interested in scaring and fear mongering their way into shaping public opinion in their favor.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">See that graph? That’s a margin of error graph. What's margin of error, you ask? Statisticshowto.com defines margin of error as telling you “how many percentage points your results will differ from the real population value. For example, a 95% confidence interval with a 4 percent margin of error means that your statistic will be within 4 percentage points of the real population value 95% of the time”. For example, if a poll states that there is a 98% confidence interval of 4.88 and 5.26, that means if the poll is repeated using the same techniques, the sample will be a true measurement of the population (fall between 4.88 and 5.26) 98% of the time. What the margin of error graph shows us is a physical representation of the population measurement possibilities.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">We want our data to be right in the middle, so that half of the samples potentially fall over the actual population measurement and half of the samples potentially fall over the actual measurement. The larger the sample size, the smaller the margin of error gets. Therefore, the larger your sample size, the more accurate your population measurement will be. Look at the table and graph below:</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-center">Do you see how fast the margin of error drops? Pollfish reports that an acceptable margin of error used by most survey researchers typically falls between 4% and 8% at the 95% confidence level. If you’re surveying the entire US population, you only have to survey 150 people to have an 8% margin of error. You only have to survey 600 to get to a 4% margin of error! That isn’t a lot of people considering the US has a population of approximately 328,200,000.<div>
